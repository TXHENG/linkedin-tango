# XH's React Boilerplate

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Here are the packages that is usually used in my stack:

- React + Typescript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Material UI (MUI)
- Notistack
- TanStack Store
- React Router DOM
- ESLint & Prettier

The EsList & Prettier are config with the setup that I usally used when developing. This boilerplate also includes some recommended VS Code extensions that can help to have better code maintainability.
